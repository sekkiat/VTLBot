# VTLBot

A console application that targeted Shopee. During the covid period, Singapore released a program called VTL. This program 
allows fully vaccinated travelers from VTL countries may enter Singapore or Malaysia without quarantine and just need to undergo COVID-19 testing. However, there are limited seats and most people will take around 1 week or more to get a single ticket as thousands of people were waiting for it. Therefore, I have created a bot, implementing the multi-thread concept to monitor the ticket availability, and automatically checkout process to increase the chance of getting the tickets.
